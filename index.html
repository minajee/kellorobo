<p>Electronics</p>

<p>The robot needs some controls and a display for setting of time. Also piezo for alarm and motors and motor controller are needed. We used a hd44780 2x16 character display and a rotary encoder with pressbutton as controls. The provided motor controller A4953 was not well The PCB was drawn with kicad and milled with the Fablabs Roland Monofab miniature mill. PCB was two sided and we managed to get good cutting quality and accuracy. We needed to take attenion on turning over the PCB when milling the other side so its aligned with the other side. Also when designing two sided PCB to be milled in Fablab you have to make separate vias (holes that should have some conducting material to trasfer electricity to other side) since atleast the time we manufactured our PCB there were no possibility to plate the holes with copper. Dimensons of the PCB were about 130x50mm. It took about one hour to cut after we got the parameters correct for the mill. commit 37f5d2f7b62b3943521e752c83a12c05746b1eac</p>

<p>SOFTWARE:</p>

<p>Source code</p>

<p>Kellorobo needs some intelligence under its hood to operate. It needs code that interacts with environment; uses motors, display, piezo, ultrasonic sensor and rotary encoder.</p>

<p>May 2016</p>

<p>Started working on source code.</p>

<p>Baby steps... Testing how to interact with hardware in software, found out that selected backlight pin cannot provide power.</p>

<p>June 2016</p>

<p>Battling with rotary encoder, it was really hard to get good results out of it.</p>

<p>First idea was just to quickly test it by polling, later moved to interrupt based interpretation of encoder, which still was troubled. Best results were got by running for-loop based poll in interrupt.</p>

<p>Rotary encoder's button was completely unusable at first, but later it was found out that our pin definition was wrong.</p>

<p>July 2016</p>

<p>Separated software in menu/user interface, time running and alarm functions. Later all of these were combined. After cleaning and debugging code snippets started to work together surprisingly well.</p>

<p>Rotary button was changed from polling to interrupt-based reading.</p>

<p>User interface was further developed to have ability to set time and alarm, as well as to toggle alarm on/off.</p>

<p>August 2016</p>

<p>Experimenting with piezo, found out that it is too quiet.</p>

<p>HARDWARE:</p>

<p>First frame:</p>

<p>8.4.2016</p>

<p>We designed and assembled our first proto for a frame.</p>

<p>It is made out of 4mm plywood and designed with Inkscape's "Tabbed box maker" -extension.</p>

<p>The proto case came out a bit too narrow since the motors barely fit inside.</p>

<p>We observed that the shaft on our motors are too short and the frame must have a hole not just for the shaft, but the whole gearbox.</p>

<p>That's the best way to have more accessible shaft on a quick schedule.</p>

<p>Final frame:</p>

<p>19.4.2016</p>

<p>Designed a new frame with a more tank-like look.</p>

<p>The new frame has chamfered ends, a better placement for the motors and more compact design.</p>

<p>Drawn with inkscape. We cut the frame parts from 4mm plywood and assembled it using some wood glue for the joints.</p>

<p>The motors fit quite nicely and the overall look is much better than in the first proto.</p>

<p>There is no lid in the frame since it will be 3D-printed.</p>

<p>Case lid:</p>

<p>11.5.2016, 26.5.2016</p>

<p>Only a single proto was made of lid, since the part is mostly for looks.</p>

<p>Finished the top lid design and printed it with leapfrog creatr. The print took 3h 17 min with 0.35mm layer thickness to complete.</p>

<p>Since the part is relatively large, it came away from the print bed a bit. Anyway the print managed to complete with poorish quality.</p>

<p>15 meters of orange 1.75 mm PLA filament was used.</p>

<p>Motor holder:</p>

<p>21.4.2016</p>

<p>Designed a part that holds the motors in place. Used FreeCAD. The holder will be fastened to the bottom of the case with screws.</p>

<p>Did not 3D-print the part yet since the other printer is broken and the other was reserved at the time.</p>

<p>29.4.2016</p>

<p>Printed the motor holder that was designed last time. Used the Formlabs Form 2 SLA 3D-printer with clear resin.</p>

<p>The print came out really nice considering that I used the roughest (0.10mm) layer thickness. The print took 2 hours to complete.</p>

<p>Motor holder support:</p>

<p>3.5.2016</p>

<p>Attached the 3D-printed motor holder but it was too flexible so we</p>

<p>made a motor holder support piece from 4mm acrylic sheet on top of the motor holder.</p>

<p>Used inkscape to design the part. Some double sided tape was used to help the motors stay in place.</p>

<p>Rotary encoder knob:</p>

<p>26.5.2016</p>

<p>Designed a knob for the rotary encoder so that it's easier to turn.</p>

<p>Work file:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/minajee/kellorobo/commit/5b9818eb7c36cf3f0a0bba42a8bcabab4b5cea96">https://github.com/minajee/kellorobo/commit/5b9818eb7c36cf3f0a0bba42a8bcabab4b5cea96</a></p>

<p>Whole robot mechanics:</p>

<p>7.6.2016</p>

<p>Assembled the case and fit all the parts in.</p>

<p>The top lid print quality was absolutely horrible, so some of the holes needed to be carved a bit bigger.</p>

<p>We also printed the knob for the rotary encoder. Took about 15 minutes with the Leapfrog.</p>

<p>26.6.2016 1h</p>

<p>Assembled the robot and took some pictures.</p>
