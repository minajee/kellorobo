Also piezo for alarm and motors and motor controller are needed. We used a hd44780 2x16 character display and a rotary encoder with pressbutton as controls. The provided motor controller A4953 was not well The PCB was drawn with kicad and milled with the Fablabs Roland Monofab miniature mill. PCB was two sided and we managed to get good cutting quality and accuracy. We needed to take attenion on turning over the PCB when milling the other side so its aligned with the other side. Also when designing two sided PCB to be milled in Fablab you have to make separate vias (holes that should have some conducting material to trasfer electricity to other side) since atleast the time we manufactured our PCB there were no possibility to plate the holes with copper. Dimensons of the PCB were about 130x50mm. It took about one hour to cut after we got the parameters correct for the mill. commit 37f5d2f7b62b3943521e752c83a12c05746b1eac\r\n\r\nSOFTWARE:\r\n\r\nSource code\r\n\r\nKellorobo needs some intelligence under its hood to operate. It needs code that interacts with environment; uses motors, display, piezo, ultrasonic sensor and rotary encoder.\r\n\r\nMay 2016\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStarted working on source code.\r\n\r\nBaby steps... Testing how to interact with hardware in software, found out that selected backlight pin cannot provide power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 2016\r\n\r\nBattling with rotary encoder, it was really hard to get good results out of it.\r\n\r\nFirst idea was just to quickly test it by polling, later moved to interrupt based interpretation of encoder, which still was troubled. Best results were got by running for-loop based poll in interrupt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRotary encoder's button was completely unusable at first, but later it was found out that our pin definition was wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 2016\r\n\r\nSeparated software in menu/user interface, time running and alarm functions. Later all of these were combined. After cleaning and debugging code snippets started to work together surprisingly well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRotary button was changed from polling to interrupt-based reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUser interface was further developed to have ability to set time and alarm, as well as to toggle alarm on/off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 2016\r\n\r\nExperimenting with piezo, found out that it is too quiet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARDWARE:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst frame:\r\n\r\n8.4.2016\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe designed and assembled our first proto for a frame.\r\n\r\nIt is made out of 4mm plywood and designed with Inkscape's \"Tabbed box maker\" -extension.\r\n\r\nThe proto case came out a bit too narrow since the motors barely fit inside.\r\n\r\nWe observed that the shaft on our motors are too short and the frame must have a hole not just for the shaft, but the whole gearbox.\r\n\r\nThat's the best way to have more accessible shaft on a quick schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotos:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/minajee/kellorobo/commit/b439d73c7e4ea52fefee4d4d5034f8a7b35bb107#diff-e014cbcdde8bb313d86964fa1ce378a4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork files:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/minajee/kellorobo/commit/74d22f9f316b8c5ca32c1192a2f953d998de79a5#diff-5733cebc9dafcf89803ee458dcfde637\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal frame:\r\n\r\n19.4.2016\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDesigned a new frame with a more tank-like look.\r\n\r\nThe new frame has chamfered ends, a better placement for the motors and more compact design.\r\n\r\nDrawn with inkscape. We cut the frame parts from 4mm plywood and assembled it using some wood glue for the joints.\r\n\r\nThe motors fit quite nicely and the overall look is much better than in the first proto.\r\n\r\nThere is no lid in the frame since it will be 3D-printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/minajee/kellorobo/commit/018625ba336d3f6e999a34979a40850befa10d69\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/minajee/kellorobo/commit/dde10c66f4365e4fb8932312f1fa12e5db3ef59a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork files:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/minajee/kellorobo/commit/f5924ef09552002ed55b75c43ee6904ea76f37c8#diff-5733cebc9dafcf89803ee458dcfde637\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCase lid:\r\n\r\n11.5.2016, 26.5.2016\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly a single proto was made of lid, since the part is mostly for looks.\r\n\r\nFinished the top lid design and printed it with leapfrog creatr. The print took 3h 17 min with 0.35mm layer thickness to complete.\r\n\r\nSince the part is relatively large, it came away from the print bed a bit. Anyway the print managed to complete with poorish quality.\r\n\r\n15 meters of orange 1.75 mm PLA filament was used.\r\n\r\nPhotos:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/minajee/kellorobo/commit/bda1e3bebcfeac88cd54d9521e9ee2cf57deacb1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork files:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/minajee/kellorobo/commit/8879463a9872b062b11b27392cf75194204512c9\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/minajee/kellorobo/commit/1211a244b87fd5627d5912f05ba880987185bb3a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMotor holder:\r\n\r\n21.4.2016\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDesigned a part that holds the motors in place. Used FreeCAD. The holder will be fastened to the bottom of the case with screws.\r\n\r\nDid not 3D-print the part yet since the other printer is broken and the other was reserved at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotos:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/minajee/kellorobo/commit/00e6d004f41a75d1744eaad3a38b58b9656d1369\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork files:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/minajee/kellorobo/commit/3746ac202f2f66431eb920fe414c569af231e17b\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29.4.2016\r\n\r\nPrinted the motor holder that was designed last time. Used the Formlabs Form 2 SLA 3D-printer with clear resin.\r\n\r\nThe print came out really nice considering that I used the roughest (0.10mm) layer thickness. The print took 2 hours to complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/minajee/kellorobo/commit/670cc17d72a2f93e794704186b70ea18edef07d1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMotor holder support:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.5.2016\r\n\r\nAttached the 3D-printed motor holder but it was too flexible so we\r\n\r\nmade a motor holder support piece from 4mm acrylic sheet on top of the motor holder.\r\n\r\nUsed inkscape to design the part. Some double sided tape was used to help the motors stay in place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork file:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/minajee/kellorobo/commit/40998bae60bafc119d0c3bc0d7f89c7fea9eaf02#diff-5733cebc9dafcf89803ee458dcfde637\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto (last photo in commit):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/minajee/kellorobo/commit/dde10c66f4365e4fb8932312f1fa12e5db3ef59a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRotary encoder knob:\r\n\r\n26.5.2016\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDesigned a knob for the rotary encoder so that it's easier to turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork file:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/minajee/kellorobo/commit/5b9818eb7c36cf3f0a0bba42a8bcabab4b5cea96\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhole robot mechanics:\r\n\r\n7.6.2016\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssembled the case and fit all the parts in.\r\n\r\nThe top lid print quality was absolutely horrible, so some of the holes needed to be carved a bit bigger.\r\n\r\nWe also printed the knob for the rotary encoder. Took about 15 minutes with the Leapfrog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26.6.2016 1h\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssembled the robot and took some pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotos:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/minajee/kellorobo/commit/bda1e3bebcfeac88cd54d9521e9ee2cf57deacb1\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal hours spent on project: 90\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/5WewnZcXmrQ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
