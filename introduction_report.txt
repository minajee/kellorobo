________Introduction to project_________________

The idea of the project is to build an alarm clock that runs away when the alarm is triggered. Essentially this is a robot.
Our concept will feature an lcd screen, flashing lights, and a buzzer. The robot will move on continuous track in a similar manner to a tank or a caterpillar.
As the robot is moving it has to ensure that it doesn't crash into anything. An ultrasound sensor module will be used for that.
The frame and the continuous track  will be constructed of 4mm plywood by laser cutting, since it is much faster than 3D-printing.
Some small parts will 3D-printed though.

On the LCD will be printed the current time and the alarm time. The alarm will be set with a rotary controller.
Our goal is to build a device that is user-friendly and independent of other equipment, such as a computer (to set alarm time etc.).
We also thought that a robot moving on wheels would be too easy to implement, hence the continuous track is used.

The collision prevention will be implemented with the aforementrioned ultrasound module since we have some modules already and it should be easy enough to use.
We also considered of using a passive infrared sensor to detect obstacles. 

The continuous track structure is better explained in the image "track_structure.jpg".
