For each part you fabricate, the following has to be included in your project page:

     * Part working title
     * Description of what this part was made for (i.e. why was it made)
     * Link to the commit that contains the versions of your models that were used to print this part
     * A photo of the part
     * Amount of material used to make the part, and printing time (also mark down which printer you used)
     * Notes about designing, fabricating and testing the part (what did you learn?)

Electronics

The robot needs some controls and a display for setting of time. 
Also piezo for alarm and motors and motor controller are needed.

We used a hd44780 2x16 character display and a rotary encoder with pressbutton as controls.
The provided motor controller A4953 was not well
The PCB was drawn with kicad and milled with the Fablabs Roland Monofab miniature mill.
PCB was two sided and we managed to get good cutting quality and accuracy.
We needed to take attenion on turning over the PCB when milling the other side so its aligned with the other side. 
Also when designing two sided PCB to be milled in Fablab you have to make separate vias (holes that should have some conducting  material to trasfer electricity to other side) since atleast the time we manufactured our PCB there were no possibility to plate the holes with copper.
Dimensons of the PCB were about 130x50mm. It took about one hour to cut after we got the parameters correct for the mill.
