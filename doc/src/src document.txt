Source code

Kellorobo needs some intelligence under its hood to operate. It needs code that interacts with environment; uses motors, display, piezo, ultrasonic sensor and rotary encoder.


May 2016

Started working on source code.

Baby steps... Testing how to interact with hardware in software, found out that selected backlight pin cannot provide power.


June 2016

Battling with rotary encoder, it was really hard to get good results out of it.
First idea was just to quickly test it by polling, later moved to interrupt based interpretation of encoder, which still was troubled. Best results were got by running for-loop based poll in interrupt.

Rotary encoder's button was completetely unusable at first, but later it was found out that our pin definition was wrong.


July 2016

Separated software in menu/user interface, time running and alarm functions. Later all of these were combined. After cleaning and debugging code snippets started to work together surprisingly well.

Rotary button was changed from polling to interrupt-based reading.

User interface was further developed to have ability to set time and alarm, as well as to toggle alarm on/off.


August 2016

Experimenting with piezo, found out that it is too quiet.
