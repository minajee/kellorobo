First frame:

8.4.2016

We designed and assembled our first proto for a frame.
It is made out of 4mm plywood and designed with Inkscape's "Tabbed box maker" -extension.
The proto case came out a bit too narrow since the motors barely fit inside.
We observed that the shaft on our motors are too short and the frame must have a hole not just for the shaft, but the whole gearbox.
That's the best way to have more accessible shaft on a quick schedule.

Final frame:

19.4.2016

Designed a new frame with a more tank-like look.
The new frame has chamfered ends, a better placement for the motors and more compact design.
Drawn with inkscape. We cut the frame parts from 4mm plywood and assembled it using some wood glue for the joints.
The motors fit quite nicely and the overall look is much better than in the first proto.
There is no lid in the frame since it will be 3D-printed.

Case lid:

11.5.2016, 26.5.2016

Only a single proto was made of lid, since the part is mostly for looks.
Finished the top lid design and printed it with leapfrog creatr. The print took 3h 17 min with 0.35mm layer thickness to complete.
Since the part is relatively large, it came away from the print bed a bit. Anyway the print managed to complete with poorish quality.
15 meters of orange 1.75 mm PLA filament was used.

Motor holder:

21.4.2016

Designed a part that holds the motors in place. Used FreeCAD. The holder will be fastened to the bottom of the case with screws.
Did not 3D-print the part yet since the other printer is broken and the other was reserved at the time.

29.4.2016

Printed the motor holder that was designed last time. Used the Formlabs Form 2 SLA 3D-printer with clear resin.
The print came out really nice considering that I used the roughest (0.10mm) layer thickness. The print took 2 hours to complete.

Motor holder support:

3.5.2016

Attached the 3D-printed motor holder but it was too flexible so we
made a motor holder support piece from 4mm acrylic sheet on top of the motor holder.
Used inkscape to design the part. Some double sided tape was used to help the motors stay in place.

Rotary encoder knob:

26.5.2016

Designed a knob for the rotary encoder so that it's easier to turn.

Whole robot mechanics:

7.6.2016

Assembled the case and fit all the parts in.
The top lid print quality was absolutely horrible, so some of the holes needed to be carved a bit bigger.
We also printed the knob for the rotary encoder. Took about 15 minutes with the Leapfrog.

26.6.2016   1h

Assembled the robot and took some pictures.
