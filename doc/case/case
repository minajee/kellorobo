@mitjakarki designed and assembled our first proto for a frame. It is made out of 4mm plywood and designed wit$
The proto case came out a bit too narrow since the motors barely fit inside.
We observed that the shaft on our motors are too short and the frame must have a hole not just for the shaft, $
That's the best way to have more accessible shaft on a quick schedule.
