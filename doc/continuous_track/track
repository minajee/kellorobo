For each part you fabricate, the following has to be included in your project page:

     * Part working title
     * Description of what this part was made for (i.e. why was it made)
     * Link to the commit that contains the versions of your models that were used to print this part
     * A photo of the part
     * Amount of material used to make the part, and printing time (also mark down which printer you used)
     * Notes about designing, fabricating and testing the part (what did you learn?)

Continuous track
