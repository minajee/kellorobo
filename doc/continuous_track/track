For each part you fabricate, the following has to be included in your project page:

     * Part working title
     * Description of what this part was made for (i.e. why was it made)
     * Link to the commit that contains the versions of your models that were used to print this part
     * A photo of the part
     * Amount of material used to make the part, and printing time (also mark down which printer you used)
     * Notes about designing, fabricating and testing the part (what did you learn?)

Continuous track

We chose to make continuous track instead of wheels.

We used 4mm plywood and about 1,5mm thick aluminium wire to manufacture the track elements and pins for them.
About 30x30 cm piece of plywood is needed so not much materials required, but the construction required lots of work.
The pin holes were designed so that the pin would attach without glue. 
The outer elements were made to have tight holes and Inner elements loose hole.
