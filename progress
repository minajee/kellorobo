Ajankäyttö

Suunnittelimme alustavasti millainen robotin toiminta tulisi olemaan.
Meillä ei ollut vielä komponentteja tässä vaiheessa joten suunnittelu meni arvailuksi.

   -lcd
   -ultraäänisensori

Continuous track - Proof of consept

Started making a continuous track by ourselves. Designed chain pieces and a couple of gears  with Inkscape.
The chain is constructed of two different kind of pieces and a piece of wire connecting them.
The smaller piece is a circle with 7.5 mm diameter and the bigger piece is a rounded rectangle 13x7.5mm.
Holes in the pieces have a 1.5mm diameter as the  connecting wire is around 1.2 mm thick.
Finally, the parts were laser cut from 4mm clear acrylic sheet.


We screwed the gears to a piece of cardboard and strained the continuous track between the gears. As you spin the other gear, the whole system starts rotating.
It works!

Proof of concept is a success.

Second attempt at making a continuous track

I drew the continuous track elements. Sprocket is not ready yet, but i made some calculations and i know what it should look like.
